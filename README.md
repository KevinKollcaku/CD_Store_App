# CD_Store_App

This is a school project. The idea was to make a program that could facilitate the basic operations that a CD Store would have to perform. This operations would be things like:
  - adding new CD/supliers/emplyees/geners
  - recording every buying that was being made
  - giving the performance of every employee
  etc
 I have developed this app using java, and the javafx library that will handle the part of GUI. The Project has been worked in Visual Studio Code editor.
 
 ## Implementation
 
 The program would while running would look something like this
